In the beginning of time, the first God of the universe, Pan Gu, lived an immortal life. But with no subjects to lord over, Pan Gu grew tired of his solitary existence and decided to decompose his body into five elements-fire, metal, wood, earth, and water. With his divine power, Pan Gu forged these elements into air, land, mountains, rivers, seas, and plant life and laid the foundation for a new world. It was then that Pan Gu made his first attempt to fill this new world with life. From his shadow he formed the first sentient beings. These unnamed creatures were uncivilized, and before long, they began turning on one another and corrupting the world around them. Pan Gu saw that what he had created had become an Imperfect World, and moved quickly to rectify his mistake. He built a floating city known as Tear of Heaven, and placed within the city the few creatures that had yet to be corrupted. Then, with the power of water and wind, Pan Gu created a massive flood, which swept through the land and destroyed all life in its path.
<br><br>The world now cleansed, Pan Gu set about creating a new world, one filled with beings who were capable of Spiritual Cultivation. He created three races that possessed the traits he most treasured in himself. The Human race was born of Pan Gu's spirit, and demonstrated morality, honor, and an unlimited imagination. The race of the Beastkind, born of Pan Gu's body, embodied freedom and peace, and possessed a unique connection with the natural order of the world. And the third race, the Wing Elfs, were born of Pan Gu's own blood, and exemplified beauty, grace, and purity. Between the three races, the Perfect World was created.
<br><br>The chief quality that Pan Gu gave all three races was free will. He vowed never again to eradicate an entire species, so all conflicts between the races were to be resolved amongst themselves. One such conflict arose between the Humans and Wing Elfs when the two races discovered the city of Heaven's Tear. A war erupted as they fought for control of the great city, bringing out the worst in both races. The Beastkind remained neutral, as they were content with living in harmony with the natural world. As the war intensified, and neither side relented, a new threat emerged.
<br><br>The race that was thought to have been eradicated in the great flood returned in full force. These creatures were not quite living, but not quite dead, and thus came to be known as rancorn forces. The rancorn forces appeared to possess a singular objective: to destroy the other races and corrupt the beautiful world around them. Rumors swirled that the rancorn forces were capable of possessing other living things. Not much is known about the true nature of this evil, but one thing is clear. The three races Human, Beastkind, and Wing Elf must set aside their differences and unite to preserve their way of life, halt the spread of corruption, and above all, protect the Perfect World.

Upon uncovering a strange Rancorn Plot, old memories are awakened and ancient mysteries become important. A magic relic, the Chrono Wheel, becomes necessary as it is the only way to travel back 1000 years in the past to investigate the roots of the Rancorn Forces and uncover the truth about the beginning of the Millennium War. The player travels through time visiting various historic events in Perfect World.
<br><br>The Millennium War is one of the main historical periods of Perfect World. Called the Millennium War because it lasted for a thousand years, this conflict between the Wing Elfs and Humans only ended when the pressing threat of the Rancorn Forces forced a truce. Understandably, there is still much animosity between the Elfs and Humans. The initial cause of the strife and the even that brought tempers to a head leading to all out war, is known as the Massacre of Unicorn Forest. The story goes that the Wing Elfs brutally murdered a group of humans, but as it is with history, stories vary.
<br><br>But only by visiting other times of peril for Perfect World can the full truth be known. Another tale tells of the northern Savagians who invaded the western Human countries. Led by the dark lord Wanyi, they advanced rapidly to the Valley of the Scarred, where the City of Vanish is now located. The whole West Land fought the Savagians at the Valley of the Scarred. In the early days of the war, the allied force was almost wiped out. The West Land was in danger, until a defender came with help from an unlikely ally and saved Perfect World. Who was this powerful friend?
<br><br>Answering this question ultimately leads to even more intriguing mysteries, namely the situation surrounding the fall of the Holy Empire. The player must research the real story behind Chungyun and the Princess of Moonlight. As the saga unfolds, the player will fight through Nimbustian Guards and have a chance to meet this couple of legend, ultimately making a choice that will change the fate of the present.

<b><font size="4">Dawn of Spirits</b><br><br>
There is a world in where the abundance of creatures we know can live, our Perfect World. However, there exists other worlds, such as the Underworld where ghosts live, where things are totally different from the Perfect World. Besides these two worlds, there is another mystical world in this universe, the Elemental World.
<br><br>The five elements, metal, wood, water, fire and earth, are the basis for system of life in Perfect World. This system existed before the gods created human, and it dominates the birth, age, illness and death of all creatures. Some people, after hardworking cultivation, have been able to learn a few elemental skills. However, few know the true meaning of the five elements.
<br><br>Perfect World, the Underworld and the Elemental World exist in a delicate balance together. In the Elemental World, the Five Elemental Airs, each with a distinct color, dominate everything. The Five Elemental Airs system of the Elemental World is deeply intertwined with the Five Elements system in Perfect World. Anytime a system in one world becomes unbalanced, the other world will feel the change.
<br><br>Before the worlds were created, the universe was in chaos, there were no elements, no creatures, no feeling and no thought. As billions of years passed, things began to evolve. After the creation of Perfect World, creatures with intelligence appeared. They had a mighty power named belief, which helped them to be the ruler of the world. At the same time, the five elements, developed thoughts and wills of their own, and finally evolved into a mystic being. Elemental Elf.
<br><br>Elemental Elfs or Spirits are the babies of the five elements. They know how to use elemental skills innately and have a basic instinct to keep the balance of the all worlds. Elemental Elfs mainly live in Elemental World, seldom of them can be seen in Perfect World. However, things are changing..
<br><br>In the endless war between the Eastern Emperor Ching and Yaksa Tribes, Ching killed a god who was worshiped by Yaksa Tribes. This incident greatly destroyed the root of water and wood, unbalancing the Five Element System. At the same time, gods have been disappearing, ghosts are peeping everywhere, the situation has become worse and worse, and it seems that Perfect World may be coming to its end... However, the Elemental Elfs, with their innate instinct of maintaining the balance of the Five Elements System, have risen to save Perfect World.
